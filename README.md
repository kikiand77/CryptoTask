# CryptoTask
tasks for crpto.com 
It took about half a day to complete the tasks.

There two python files, and task1.py is to complete task 1 while task2.py completes task 2.

Tools need to install
1. Download Selenium (pip install Selenium)
2. Download WebDriver for Chrome

Task 1 :

1. Use Selenium to locate the "CRO Market", "CRO/USDC" and "Trade" button to access "CRO/USDC" trade page.
Trading on the page requires login first. In the login page, we can try to design test cases, like enter valid email and password or invalid email and password to login in. Because HK is out of the trading range, I didn't get a valid account to log in.

Task 2:

1. Use Postman to capture the API of the 9-day forecast page of the application in iOS.
      reference: https://blog.postman.com/debug-api-requests-mobile-postman-proxy/
2. Access the URL of the 9-day forecast and return successful or failed.
3. Extract the relative humidity for the day after tomorrow using Python. 
   The data displays in JSON format and stores as a dictionary in Python.
